You are an expert curriculum designer and synthetic data generator for AI. Your sole task is to create a single, high-quality, and realistic JSON data point for fine-tuning an educational video segment classifier.

Your goal is to simulate a scenario where a "Forensic VLM" has analyzed a video and produced a detailed, structured report of an **irrelevant** segment that abruptly interrupts a flow of relevant, educational content.

### **Inputs to Guide Generation**

1.  **`VIDEO_TOPIC`**: `{{data.video_topic}}`
2.  **`IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO`**: `{{data.scenario}}`
3.  **`DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`**: `{{data.size}}`
4.  **`NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS`**: `{{data.n_prev}}`

### **Your Process**

1.  **Adhere to the `VIDEO_TOPIC`**: The entire data point must be centered around this topic.

2.  **Invent a Relevant Context**: First, internally create a logical, *relevant* lesson flow. You will write a `previous_segments_summary` as a list containing exactly **`{NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS}`** short descriptions. These descriptions must be on-topic and build upon each other, simulating the VLM's output for the preceding, *educational* segments.

3.  **Generate the Irrelevant Segment Description (Crucial - Must match VLM Output Style)**:

      * The `current_segment_description` must **NOT** be a simple paragraph. It **MUST** be a structured text block mimicking a forensic VLM report with exactly these four headers:
          * **1. Visual State Analysis**: (Activity Level, Primary Visual Subject, Detailed Description)
          * **2. Audio & Transcript Analysis**: (Audio Status, Speaker Action, Content Summary)
          * **3. Irrelevant Event Log (Forensic Detail)**: (List specific events matching the `IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO` input)
          * **4. Chronological Context Check**: (Explicitly state how this breaks or relates to the `previous_segments_summary`)
      * *Note: Ensure the content clearly reflects the `IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO` and matches the `DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`.*

4.  **Generate a "Reasoning Trace" (Chain-of-Thought)**:

      * The `reasoning` field must **NOT** be a simple summary.
      * It **MUST** be a detailed **internal monologue** or **thought trace** showing *how* an AI classifier would analyze the data (including the previous context) to reach the "Irrelevant" conclusion.
      * **Trace Structure to Simulate**:
          * **Analysis of Inputs:** "First, I am analyzing the video topic '[Topic]' and the inputs..."
          * **Contextual Analysis:** "Checking the previous segments: They described [Summary of Prev Segments]. Does this context explicitly predict a silent visual demonstration? [Yes/No]..."
          * **Audio/Transcript Evaluation:** "Analyzing the transcript... It indicates [Silence/Off-topic speech]. This violates the Audio-First rule for relevance."
          * **Visual Evaluation:** "Visually, the screen shows [Description]. This does not redeem the off-topic audio."
          * **Scenario Matching:** "The observed events match the known irrelevant scenario of '[Scenario Name]'."
          * **Final Determination:** "Conclusion: The segment is Irrelevant."

5.  **Format as JSON**: Your final output must be **only** the single, valid JSON object with the specified keys.

### **Output JSON Structure**

Your output must be a single JSON object (do not wrap it in a list). The number of items in `previous_segments_summary` will match the `{NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS}` input.
*Ensure the "current\_segment\_description" and "reasoning" fields contain the formatted text as a single string (use `\n` for line breaks).*

```json
{
  "video_topic": "...",
  "previous_segments_summary": [
    "description of segment n-...",
    "description of segment n-2",
    "description of segment n-1"
  ],
  "current_segment_description": "**1. Visual State Analysis**\n* **Activity Level:** [Value]\n* **Primary Visual Subject:** [Value]\n* **Detailed Description:** [Text]\n\n**2. Audio & Transcript Analysis**\n* **Audio Status:** [Value]\n* **Speaker Action:** [Value]\n* **Content Summary:** [Text]\n\n**3. Irrelevant Event Log (Forensic Detail)**\n* [Text]\n\n**4. Chronological Context Check**\n* [Text]",
  "type": "Irrelevant",
  "reasoning": "First, I am analyzing the video topic '...'.\n\nChecking the previous segments: They focused on [Concept A] and [Concept B]. The narrative flow was active teaching. There was no prediction of a silent pause or visual-only break.\n\nAnalyzing the transcript: The audio contains [Silence/Off-topic speech]. This fails the primary check for educational content.\n\nVisually, the screen shows [Visual State], which confirms the lack of active instruction.\n\nThe activity matches the known irrelevant scenario of '[Scenario]'.\n\nConclusion: The segment is Irrelevant."
