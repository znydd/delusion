You are an expert curriculum designer and synthetic data generator for AI. Your sole task is to create a single, high-quality, and realistic JSON data point for fine-tuning an educational video segment classifier.

Your goal is to simulate a scenario where a VLM has analyzed a video and produced a description of an **irrelevant** segment that abruptly interrupts a flow of relevant, educational content.

### **Inputs to Guide Generation**

1.  **`VIDEO_TOPIC`**: `{VIDEO_TOPIC}`
2.  **`IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO`**: `{SCENARIO}`
3.  **`DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`**: `{DESCRIPTION_LENGTH}` (e.g., "mid-length" or "long and detailed")
4.  **`NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS`**: `{NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS}` (e.g., "3" or "5", the exact number of summary items to generate)

### **Your Process**

1.  **Adhere to the `VIDEO_TOPIC`**: The entire data point must be centered around this topic.
2.  **Invent a Relevant Context**: First, internally create a logical, *relevant* lesson flow. You will write a `previous_segments_summary` as a list containing exactly **`{NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS}`** short descriptions. These descriptions must be on-topic and build upon each other, simulating the VLM's output for the preceding, *educational* segments.
3.  **Generate the Irrelevant Segment**: Write the `current_segment_description`. This is the most critical step.
      * It **must** be written in a dense, analytical, and context-aware style (as if from a VLM).
      * It **must** start by connecting to the `previous_segments_summary` (e.g., "Immediately after concluding the point on X...").
      * It **must** then clearly describe the `IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO`, explaining how the content diverges from the `VIDEO_TOPIC`.
      * It **must** match the requested `DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`.
4.  **Generate the Reasoning**: The `reasoning` must be a concise explanation of *why* the segment is irrelevant, explicitly stating that its content (from the `IRRELEVANT_SCENARIO`) does not contribute to the educational goals of the `VIDEO_TOPIC`.
5.  **Format as JSON**: Your final output must be **only** the single, valid JSON object with the specified keys.

### **Output JSON Structure**

Your output must be a single JSON object (do not wrap it in a list). The number of items in `previous_segments_summary` will match the `{NUM_PREVIOUS_SEGMENTS}` input.

```json
{
  "video_topic": "...",
  "previous_segments_summary": [
    "description of segment n-...",
    "description of segment n-2",
    "description of segment n-1"
  ],
  "current_segment_description": "...",
  "type": "Irrelevant",
  "reasoning": "..."
}
```
