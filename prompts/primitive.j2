You are an expert curriculum designer and synthetic data generator for AI. Your sole task is to create **50** high-quality, unique, and realistic JSON data points for fine-tuning an educational video segment classifier.

Your goal is to simulate 50 different scenarios where a VLM has analyzed an educational video and produced a description of an **irrelevant** segment.

### **Inputs to Guide Generation (Use as Baseline Inspiration)**

1.  **`BASE_VIDEO_TOPIC`**: `{{ data.video_topic }}` (e.g., "Computer Science," "History," "Physics")
2.  **`BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE`**: `{{ data.scenario }}` (e.g., "Sponsorship," "Off-topic personal story," "Asking viewers to subscribe")
3.  **`DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`**: `{{ data.size }}` (e.g., "mid-length" or "long and detailed")

### **Your Process**

You will generate a list of 50 JSON objects. For each of the 50 objects, you must perform the following steps to ensure **every data point is unique**:

1.  **Invent a Unique `video_topic`**:

      * Do not use the `BASE_VIDEO_TOPIC` directly.
      * Instead, invent a **new, specific, and unique academic/technical topic** that is *inspired by* the `BASE_VIDEO_TOPIC`.
      * *Example*: If `BASE_VIDEO_TOPIC` is "Computer Science," you could invent "Python for Beginners: Dictionaries," "Advanced Java: Multithreading," "SQL Database Normalization," etc.

2.  **Invent a Unique Irrelevant Scenario and Description**:

      * Do not use the `BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE` directly.
      * Instead, invent a **new, specific, and unique scenario** that *fits the theme* of the `BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE`.
      * *Example*: If `BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE` is "Sponsorship," you could invent "describing a new web hosting service," "unboxing a new mechanical keyboard," "reading a script for a meal-kit delivery," etc.
      * **Write the `description`**: This is the most critical step.
          * The description **must** be written in a dense, analytical, and context-aware style (as if from a VLM).
          * It **must** clearly describe the **unique scenario** you just invented.
          * It **must** explicitly frame this unique scenario in contrast to the **unique `video_topic`** you just invented (e.g., "This segment of the **[Invented Video Topic]** lesson does not cover course material; instead, it consists of..." or "The segment abruptly diverges from the **[Invented Video Topic]** to...").
          * It **must** match the requested `DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`.

3.  **Generate Unique Reasoning**:

      * The `reasoning` must be a concise explanation of *why* the segment is irrelevant.
      * It **must** be unique for each data point, explicitly connecting the **unique `video_topic`** with the **unique `description`** (e.g., "The description details a sponsorship read, which does not advance the educational goal of teaching 'SQL Database Normalization'.").

4.  **Format as JSON List**:

      * Your final output must be **only** a single, valid JSON list containing the 50 unique JSON objects. Do not output any other text before or after the list.

### **Output JSON Structure**

Your output must be a single JSON list `[ { ... }, { ... }, ..., { ... } ]` where each object follows this structure:

```json
{
  "video_topic": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "type": "Irrelevant",
  "reasoning": "..."
}
```
