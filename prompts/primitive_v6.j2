You are an expert curriculum designer and synthetic data generator for AI. Your sole task is to create **10** high-quality, unique, and realistic JSON data points for fine-tuning an educational video segment classifier.

Your goal is to simulate a scenario where a VLM has analyzed educational videos and produced structured descriptions of **irrelevant** segments.

### **Inputs to Guide Generation**

1.  **`VIDEO_TOPIC_LIST`**: `{{ data.video_topics }}` (A list containing exactly 10 distinct topics)
2.  **`BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE`**: `{{ data.scenario }}` 
3.  **`DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`**: `{{ data.size }}`

### **Your Process**

You will generate a single JSON list containing **exactly 10** JSON objects. You must iterate through the `VIDEO_TOPIC_LIST` one by one.

**For EACH of the 10 topics in the list, perform the following steps:**

1.  **Refine the Video Topic**:
    * Take the current topic from the `VIDEO_TOPIC_LIST`.
    * Invent a **specific, unique academic/technical sub-topic** inspired by it.
    * *Example:* If the list item is "Math", invent "Linear Algebra: Eigenvalues."

2.  **Invent a Unique Irrelevant Scenario**:
    * Using the single `BASE_SCENARIO_TYPE` provided, invent a unique specific event for *this* video.
    * *Constraint:* Even though the scenario type is the same for all 10 (e.g., all are "Interruptions"), the specific details must vary (e.g., one is a fire alarm, another is a phone ringing, another is a cleaner entering).

3.  **Write the `description` (VLM Simulation)**:
    * **CRITICAL:** The description **MUST** mimic the exact output format of a Video-Language Model.
    * *It must be a single string containing the following headers and content structure:*
        * `### Clip Description (Chronological)`: A step-by-step narration of the distraction.
        * `### Visual Details`: A list of visible objects/actions (ensure these match the distraction).
        * `### Notable Irrelevant or Off-Topic Elements`: Explicitly list the distraction here (e.g., "Screen goes black," "Speaker laughs at cat").
        * `### Transcript Summary`: A summary of what was said (or noting silence).
    * **Tone:** Objective, observational, and detailed. Do *not* say "This is irrelevant." Just describe the events. Also don't mention "VLM".

4.  **Generate a "Reasoning Trace" (Chain-of-Thought)**:
    * The `reasoning` field must be a detailed internal monologue showing *how* a classifier analyzes the VLM output to label it "Irrelevant." Don't mention about "VLM".
    * **Trace Structure**:
        * **Analysis:** "Scanning the 'Transcript Summary' and 'Visual Details'..."
        * **Observation:** "I notice the transcript mentions [X] which is unrelated to [Topic]."
        * **Rule Check:** "The 'Notable Irrelevant Elements' section explicitly flags [Event]."
        * **Conclusion:** "Therefore, this is a distraction."

5.  **Format as JSON Object**:
    * Add this object to the main list.

### **Output JSON Structure**

Your output must be a single JSON list containing exactly 10 objects: `[ {Object 1}, {Object 2}, ..., {Object 10} ]`. Ensure all newlines in the descriptions are escaped (`\n`).

**Example Object Format:**
```json
{
  "video_topic": "...",
  "description": "### Clip Description (Chronological)\nThe speaker stops writing on the whiteboard at 00:00:02. They look off-camera to the left. At 00:00:05, a loud siren is heard outside. The speaker winces and says, 'Wow, that is loud.' They stand silently waiting for the noise to pass until the clip ends.\n\n### Visual Details\n* Speaker (Male, 40s)\n* Whiteboard with partial equations\n* Window (background)\n\n### Notable Irrelevant or Off-Topic Elements\n* External noise interruption (Siren)\n* Speaker stops teaching to wait for silence\n\n### Transcript Summary\nThe speaker reacts to a loud noise outside and pauses their lecture on differential equations to wait for it to stop.",
  "type": "Irrelevant",
  "reasoning": "First, I check the Global Topic: 'Advanced Calculus'.\n\nNext, I analyze the 'Transcript Summary'. The text indicates the speaker is reacting to external noise ('Wow, that is loud') rather than explaining calculus concepts.\n\nLooking at the 'Notable Irrelevant or Off-Topic Elements', the VLM has explicitly detected 'External noise interruption' and 'Speaker stops teaching'.\n\nSince no educational content is being delivered and the flow is broken by an external event, this segment qualifies as a 'Distraction/Interruption'.\n\nFinal Decision: Irrelevant."
